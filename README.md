# Next.js TypeScript Boilerplate with App Router and Tailwind CSS

This repository serves as a boilerplate for Next.js 14 (14.2.13) projects using TypeScript, the App Router, and Tailwind CSS integration. It includes best practices and coding standards for modern Next.js development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

## Coding Standards and Best Practices

### 1. TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all files (.ts for pure TypeScript, .tsx for files with JSX)
- Define interfaces and types in separate files when they need to be shared across multiple components
- Utilize TypeScript's type inference where possible, but explicitly type where necessary for clarity
- Use `const` assertions for objects that should be treated as immutable

### 2. App Router Usage

- Use the `app/` directory for all routes and pages
- Implement layouts using the `layout.tsx` file
- Use server components by default, and client components when necessary
- Utilize the new data fetching methods provided by the App Router

### 3. Code Formatting and Structure

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and components
- Keep files and components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting

### 4. Component Development

- Prefer server components unless client-side interactivity is required
- Use the `"use client"` directive at the top of files that need to be client components
- Utilize React Server Components for improved performance
- Keep components pure and avoid side effects where possible
- Use TypeScript interfaces for prop definitions
- Implement custom hooks for reusable logic

### 5. State Management

- Use React's built-in state management (useState, useReducer) for local state
- Utilize the Context API for sharing state across components
- For complex state management, consider libraries like Zustand or Jotai

### 6. Routing

- Implement file-based routing using the App Router
- Use the `Link` component from 'next/link' for client-side navigation
- Implement dynamic routes using folder and file naming conventions
- Utilize route groups and parallel routes where appropriate

### 7. API Integration

- Use React Server Components for data fetching where possible
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use SWR or React Query for client-side data fetching and caching when necessary

### 8. Performance Optimization

- Leverage automatic code splitting provided by the App Router
- Use the Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
- Implement streaming and suspense boundaries for improved loading experiences
- Use React.memo() and useMemo() for expensive computations

### 9. Error Handling

- Implement error.tsx files for custom error handling at the route level
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages to users

### 10. Security Measures

- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Use Content Security Policy headers

### 11. Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation support
- Maintain sufficient color contrast

### 12. Testing

- Write unit tests for components and utility functions
- Implement integration tests for critical user flows
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for testing

## Tailwind CSS Usage

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Follow these best practices:

- Use utility classes for rapid development
- Create custom components for reusable UI elements
- Utilize Tailwind's responsive design utilities
- Customize the `tailwind.config.ts` file for project-specific design tokens

For more information on Tailwind CSS, refer to the [official documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).
